#### Analyzing the Correlation between NFL Rookie of the Year Winners and Draft Picks
# This project aims to investigate the relationship between NFL Rookie of the Year winners and their draft positions. Specifically, we are interested in understanding if there is a correlation between a player's draft position and their likelihood of winning the Rookie of the Year award.

### Dataset
# We collected data on all NFL Rookie of the Year winners from 2000 to 2021, including their draft position and other relevant information such as their position, team, and college. We obtained the data from the official NFL website and various other sources.

### Data Wrangling
The data collected required significant cleaning and processing before analysis. We performed the following data wrangling steps:

- Removed any incomplete or missing data
- Standardized the format of all data fields
- Created a new variable indicating the draft round of each player
- Grouped the data by draft round to facilitate analysis
