# Analyzing the Correlation between NFL Rookie of the Year Winners and Draft Picks :)
This project aims to investigate the relationship between NFL Rookie of the Year winners and their draft positions. Specifically, we are interested in understanding if there is a correlation between a player's draft position and their likelihood of winning the Rookie of the Year award.

### Dataset
We collected data on all NFL Rookie of the Year winners from 2000 to 2018, including their draft position and other relevant information such as their position, team, and college. We obtained the data from the official NFL website and various other sources.

### Data Wrangling
The data collected required significant cleaning and processing before analysis. We performed the following data wrangling steps:

- Removed any incomplete or missing data
- Standardized the format of all data fields
- Created a new variable indicating the draft round of each player
- Grouped the data by draft round to facilitate analysis

### Data Analysis
After cleaning the data, we used various statistical techniques to analyze the relationship between draft position and Rookie of the Year award winners. Specifically, we used the following methods:

- Descriptive statistics to summarize the data
- Correlation analysis to determine if there is a relationship between draft position and award winners
- Regression analysis to identify any significant predictors of winning the Rookie of the Year award

### Results
Our analysis revealed that there is a significant correlation between draft position and winning the Rookie of the Year award. Players who were drafted in the first round were more likely to win the award than those drafted in later rounds.

Furthermore, our regression analysis identified draft position as the most significant predictor of winning the award, with players drafted in the first round being significantly more likely to win than those drafted in later rounds.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis indicates that there is a correlation between draft position and winning the Rookie of the Year award in the NFL. This finding has implications for teams and their drafting strategies, as it suggests that drafting players in the early rounds may increase their likelihood of winning this prestigious award. Future research may explore other factors that contribute to Rookie of the Year success, such as college performance or team support.
